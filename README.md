When the executable file is run, you will be asked to select your main AC folde, the folder where your screenshots are saved, and the folder you would like to sort the new created folders into. This information will be stored in a newly created .txt file in the same folder as the .exe file. After which, you will be able to run the program instantaneously. I recommend putting the .exe into your screenshot folder before running.

The reason the program needs your AC root folder is that it needs to read the list of cars you have installed to figure out the length of each screenshot title. Due to this, it will not sort the screenshots of uninstalled cars.

Please do not re-upload/re-distribute without consent.
